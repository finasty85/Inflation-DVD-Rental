---IN THIS QUERY, WE CORRELATE COUNTRIES AND THEIR CORRESPONDING ECONOMIC NUMBERS---

---THIS SHOWS THE DECLINE IN RETAIL SALES AND THE CORRELATION WITH THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX. THIS DISPLAYS THE COUNTRIES WITH NEGATIVE GROWTH---

SELECT CONSUMER.COUNTRY, CONSUMER.RETAIL_SALES_PERCENTAGE, PRICES.CONSUMER_PRICE_INDEX FROM CONSUMER
INNER JOIN PRICES
ON PRICES.GAS_PRICES_US$_PER_LITER=CONSUMER.GAS_PRICES_US$_PER_LITER
WHERE CONSUMER.RETAIL_SALES_PERCENTAGE<0
ORDER BY CONSUMER.RETAIL_SALES_PERCENTAGE ASC;

---WE WANT TO DETERMINE WHERE THE MOST AFFORDABLE AREAS ARE WHILE ALSO HAVING THE LOWEST INFLATION RATE. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS WE NEED TO FIRST DETERMING THE AVERAGE OF BOTH THE AFFORDABILITY INDEX AND THE INFLATION RATE. FROM THERE WE CAN DETERMINE OUR PARAMETERS FOR AFFORDABILITY INDEX AND THE INFLATION RATE TO USE WITH OUR JOIN STATEMENT---

SELECT ROUND(AVG(AFFORDABILITY_INDEX),2) AS AIP FROM PRICES

SELECT ROUND(AVG(INFLATION_RATE),2) AS IRG FROM GDP

SELECT GDP.COUNTRY, GDP.INFLATION_RATE, PRICES.AFFORDABILITY_INDEX FROM GDP
INNER JOIN PRICES
ON PRICES.COUNTRY=GDP.COUNTRY
WHERE PRICES.AFFORDABILITY_INDEX>=1.51 AND GDP.INFLATION_RATE<13.4
ORDER BY PRICES.AFFORDABILITY_INDEX;

---WE WANT TO DETERMINETHE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE LOWEST EMPLOYMENT RATE WHILE ALSO HAVING THE HIGHEST FOOD INFLATION RATE. THIS IS AGAIN A 2 FOLD PROBLEM WHERE WE HAVE TO DETERMING THE AVERAGE FOOD INFLATION RATE AND THE EMPLOYMENT RATE. THIS WILL GIVE US OUR PARAMETERS TO FOR FOOD INFLATION RATE AND THE EMPLOYMENT RATE ON OUR JOIN STATEMENT---

SELECT ROUND(AVG(FOOD_INFLATION_RATE),2) AS FIRP FROM PRICES

SELECT ROUND(AVG(EMPLOYMENT_RATE),2) AS ERL FROM LABOR

SELECT LABOR.COUNTRY, LABOR.EMPLOYMENT_RATE, LABOR.WAGE_GROWTH, PRICES.FOOD_INFLATION_RATE FROM LABOR
INNER JOIN PRICES
ON PRICES.COUNTRY=LABOR.COUNTRY
WHERE PRICES.FOOD_INFLATION_RATE>15.05 AND LABOR.EMPLOYMENT_RATE<63.97
ORDER BY LABOR.EMPLOYMENT_RATE ASC;
